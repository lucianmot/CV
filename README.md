## LUCIAN MOT

Hello, my name is Lucian, I'm from Transylvania(Romania), not a vampire. Togheter with a team won #1 in National Case Study Competition in 2012, work at Ersnt & Young to privatize Romania's biggest nuclear power plant, and then started Visual Edge, a graphic design and web development agency, grew it to 9 full time employees. The reason why I left my company and country was because I wanted to learn more Javascript, which felt pretty complex back then, but now I just want to learn/try out as many tech stacks as possible. To me complexity is the most interesting thing.
