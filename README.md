## LUCIAN MOT

Hello, my name is Lucian, I'm from Transylvania (Romania), not a vampire. Together with a team won #1 in National Case Study Competition in 2012, work at Ersnt & Young to privatize Romania's biggest nuclear power plant, and then started Visual Edge, a graphic design and web development agency, grew it to 9 full time employees. The reason why I left my company and country was because I wanted to learn more Javascript, and there weren't as many high level opportunities to do that in Romania. Javascript felt pretty complex back then, but now I just want to learn/try out as many tech stacks as possible. Complexity is the most interesting thing to me.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

Very early on I realized that the most successful things I have done in life were all because the team aspect functioned really well, so when I started my own company I started making a conscious effort in developing this skill further.

- Won #1 in National Case Study Competition with a good team dynamic
- Built a team for my company

#### Learning -> Understanding -> Explaining

Whenever we had to do something there was always the emphasis on me to learn, then understand, then break it down for everyone in to manageable chunks of information to process.

- every project that you can find on [my company website](https://visualedge.ro/projects/?lang=en)

#### Driven to excel

Dedicated to mastering any skill I decide to undertake

- This drive is what inspired our team in the final project, which results in us building a fully functional tokenizer, parser, interpreter

## Hobbies

I'm a bit weird in regards to my hobbies, because I pick some hobbies quickly, my interest in that hobby grows really intense for about 1-3 years, and then I just simple grow bored and change hobbies. I have had a lot of hobbies in the past years. So here is a list in reverse chronological order of the more notable ones:
- Magic of The Gathering(card game)
- E-commerce start-up
- Semi-professional photography
- Business networking
- Video games
