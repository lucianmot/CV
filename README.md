## LUCIAN MOT

#### Who am I?
* Hello, my name is Lucian, I'm from Transylvania, and I'm not a vampire.
#### What have I done?
* Together with a team won #1 in National Case Study Competition in 2012, worked at Ersnt & Young to privatize Romania's biggest nuclear power plant, and then founded Visual Edge, a graphic design and web development agency, grew it to 9 full time employees.
#### Why I choose coding?
* The reason why I left my company and country was because I wanted to learn more JavaScript, and there weren't as many high level opportunities to do that in Romania. JavaScript felt pretty complex back then, but now I just want to learn/try out as many tech stacks as possible. Complexity is the most interesting thing to me.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

Very early on I realized that the most successful things I have done in life were all because the team aspect functioned really well, so when I started my own company I started making a conscious effort in developing this skill further.

- Won #1 in National Case Study Competition with a good team dynamic, the prize was everyone received a paid internship invitation
- Built a team for my company, Visual Edge

#### Learning -> Understanding -> Explaining

Whenever we had to do something, there was always the emphasis on me to learn, then understand, then break it down for everyone in to manageable chunks of information to process.

- Every project that you can find on [Visual Edge, my company website](https://visualedge.ro/projects/?lang=en)

#### Driven to excel

Dedicated to mastering any skill I decide to undertake
