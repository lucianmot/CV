## LUCIAN MOT

Hello, my name is Lucian, I'm from Transylvania(Romania), not a vampire. Togheter with a team won #1 in National Case Study Competition in 2012, work at Ersnt & Young to privatize Romania's biggest nuclear power plant, and then started Visual Edge, a graphic design and web development agency, grew it to 9 full time employees. The reason why I left my company and country was because I wanted to learn more Javascript, which felt pretty complex back then, but now I just want to learn/try out as many tech stacks as possible. To me complexity is the most interesting thing.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

Very early on a I realized that the most success things I have done in life were all because of the team aspect functioned, so when I started my own company I started making a concious effort in developing this skill further.

- Won #1 in National Case Study Competition with a good team dynamic

#### Learning/Understanding/Explaining

Whenever we had to do something there was always the emphasis on me to learn, then understand, then break it down for everyone in to manageable chunks of information to process.

Dedicated to mastering any skill I decide to undertake
